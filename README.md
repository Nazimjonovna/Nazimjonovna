Hi thereðŸ‘‹!
Hey, Iâ€™m Shakhlo â€“ your go-to Python developer with a passion for all things tech! Whether youâ€™re diving into Python itself, building APIs with Django REST Framework or FastAPI, or exploring the world of PyTorch for AI magic, Iâ€™ve got you covered.

Need help sending OTP (One-Time Passwords) to phone numbers, emails, or even via Telegram? Iâ€™m your person. Iâ€™m also well-versed in web sockets, working with ORMs, building CRM systems, and creating Telegram bots that do it all.

When it comes to data, I can guide you through the world of AI, NumPy, and Pandas, making sure you harness the power of data to its fullest potential. Iâ€™m also pretty comfortable with Docker, Ubuntu, Windows servers, and deployment, so if youâ€™re looking to launch your project smoothly, Iâ€™ll make it happen!

Letâ€™s build something awesome together!
